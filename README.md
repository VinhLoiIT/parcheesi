# parcheesi
I would implement a client-server Parcheesi game which support API for calling via socket. It would be helpful in case playing with your RL models. ;)

# Enviroment
Tested on python 3.7
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run

Open a terminal then run your server:
```
python server.py
```

Open another terminal then run a client with given username
```
python client.py {username}
```

# Development Progess
- [x] Provide a full gameplay with Console interface
- [x] Separate project into client-server architecture
- [ ] Write docs
